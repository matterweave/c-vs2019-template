# Matterweave's simple C template (VS2019)

I use this template for quickly bootstrapping new C/C++ projects on Windows where I have MSVC from Visual Studio 2019 installed.

The point of this template is to be able to immediately start writing some code and compile from a command prompt.

## Usage

Clone the repo, then `cd` into the directory in a command prompt and run `build.bat`.

## Notes

This is not a "ready made" template for any kind of project. It's a quick and dirty foundation with a couple of open variables for the kinds of customizations I tend to make. **YMMV**
